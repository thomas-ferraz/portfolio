# Thomas' Portfolio

Hello, I am Thomas, here I present my major projects.

# •	Modeling of prostheses of arms and legs by 3D reconstruction. 
Use of Computer Vision, 3D Reconstruction by Point Clouds, Microsoft Kinect (from Xbox) and Arduino to build a mechanical system able to acquire information from a body member and mirror it to generate a 3D model for creating prostheses symmetrical. Advisers: Prof. Dr. Bruno de Carvalho Albertini, Prof. Dr. Eduardo Lorenzetti Pellini and Prof. Dr. Marcelo Knörich Zuffo. Polytechnic School. 2015. From February 2016 to July 2016.

# •	Automation of the collection and storage of blood test samples. 
Project requested and financed by Fleury Group (largest laboratory network in Latin America). We reformulated the process for receiving exam samples at Fleury's analysis center, developing a mechanical system capable of automatically identifying the sample (using arduino) and an android application that is used by the health professional who performs the analysis. Polytechnic School. Advisers: Prof. Dr. Eduardo Zancul and Prof. Dr. Roseli de Deus Lopes. From February to July 2017.

# •	Controlled and automated greenhouse for monitoring and intervention of plant growth. 
Automated thermal greenhouse design for plant growth control using lighting. Temperature control was done by PID system and an Android application was developed to monitor the graphics and provide control of the thermal camera via bluetooth. Project for the Discipline of Introduction to Electrical Engineering, was recognized as the best project of the class of 2015. From September to November 2015.

# •	Vison4All. 
Mobile application for indoor locomotion of visually impaired people through sound commands. Use of Android Studio, OpenCV and Qualcomm Dragonboard 410c. Identification of obstacles on the floor by keeping track of pixel density measured by the camera. From September 2016 to March 2017.

# •	Voice2Text Application. 
Extra challenge for an Introduction to Systems and Signals course. We built an Electronic Circuit that samples the voice signal from an analog sensor and takes it to the computer that receives it through a batch file, performs digital filtering in python code and transforms it to text using an open source API. Polytechnic School. From August to December 2016.
